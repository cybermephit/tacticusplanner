Sometimes they can match sometimes no. E.g. you have top #1 priority goal that takes 8 days to farm some legendary upgrade but not all 8 day it will take full of your daily energy so the rest of energy can be used to complete other goals and #2 goal can be finish e.g. in 3 days and will have estimate \"8 (3)\"."

Certain characters like Aleph, Rev'as, Abraxas, etc., can work Since their summons are purely active abilities you can elect not to use. All those with passive summons (Archimatos on kill, Celeste when hit and a few like that) you can't use."
